| _Date_   | _Description of Performance_ |
|----------|------------------------------|
| 13.09.23 | - I can't guarantee this or confirm his words, as I worked for 1 hour and wasn't disconnected. I don't know if it was luck or if it's related to something else 😉 |
| 14.09.23 | - I'm really bummed that it stopped working, unlike yesterday's tryout... sad, of course, but I'm not giving up hope! <br> - Still I think the problem is in the code, so we will wait for action from _NoCrypt_ ;d |
|          | - After spending a couple more hours searching for a solution by trial and error, I may have found the reason.. _**(XL sucks, remember this, it's true)**_. For now, use the [_BETA version_](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1P89RgBbmnVAqtu0kF9BWo7HdJsWCCNxc) of my colab, perhaps it will still work. ***`Sorry but I didn't translate it into English(`*** |
| 15.09.23 | - This is bad, it disconnects me from the session again... at the moment I'm looking for \*_trigger words_\* that Google Colab swears at. |
|          | - I still couldn't solve the problem with disconnecting... I plan to continue tomorrow, maybe I'll have to use a different approach instead of trying to find 'forbidden words'. _NoCrypt_ - updated their repository on Hugging Face today - maybe they are also taking some actions? |
| 16.09.23 | - Did a little session disconnect test on [cameduru's](https://github.com/camenduru/stable-diffusion-webui-colab) colab - no disconnects found, may have to rewrite everything under his repo. |
| 17.09.23 | - Currently, and possibly in the future as well, out of all the possible methods that I have tested, they have all ended in failure. |
|          | - Huh. Beta version working again. |
| 18.09.23 | - I am interrupting work indefinitely. Until a solution is found (if there really is one). |

## 👉 Beginnings

#### Most of the idea and code comes from [*NoCrypt*](https://github.com/NoCrypt).
I mostly just cut down what I considered unnecessary and little used, and also made my own system for downloading and so on. | Some extensions were removed, some ***config*** files were changed so that the interface was not too cluttered, some things of course were taken from his colab - for example his script `ColabTimer` - a really useful thing, and all the little things in general.
